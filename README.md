# Demo Name Suggestion Project 
-------
This project includes companies that need a name by posting advertisements and receiving name suggestions. The company that opens the advertisement will pay the amount specified when opening the advertisement for the name it chooses from among those who propose a name. He will not be able to use the name without selecting it because all name suggestions are saved.
